# Information Retrieval System

In this project, we utilize [Grobid](https://github.com/kermitt2/grobid) to extract information from the original PDF files of articles.

We then use [Lucene](https://lucene.apache.org/) to index the extracted information.

The backend is built using [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot), and the frontend is developed with [Vue.js](https://cn.vuejs.org/).

Due to the large size of the PDF files, we are only providing the source code here. However, you can still find the data source and the data processing procedure in `introduction.pdf`. Additionally, all the system functionalities are also documented in `introduction.pdf`.
